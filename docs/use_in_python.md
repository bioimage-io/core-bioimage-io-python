Here you can find recommendations for using bioimageio.core in your Python package or scripts.

See [API reference](api/index.html) for details beyond this brief orientation.

## Run inference

The [bioimageio.core.predict][] and [predict_many][bioimageio.core.predict_many] aim to provide an easy-to-use interface
to run inference with a bioimage.io model.
See [Compatibility](compatibility.md) for a list of compatible models or browser the Model Zoo at [https://bioimage.io](https://bioimage.io).
