# Compatibility with bioimage.io resources

bioimageio.core is used on [bioimage.io](https://bioimage.io) to test resources during and after the upload process.
Results are reported as "Test reports" (bioimageio.core deployed in a generic Python environment)
as well as the bioimageio.core tool compatibility (testing a resource with bioimageio.core in a dedicated Python environment).

An overview of the latter is available [as part of the collection documentation](https://bioimage-io.github.io/collection/latest/reports_overview/).
